Required packages, as well as some that might be useful, can be installed with the requirements.txt file via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: for macusers it is necessary to install a specific version of gcc (as explained by the README for Epyt-flow).
The needed version can be installed with brew:

```bash
brew install gcc@15
```
